# Deep-Photo-Style-Transfer

Implemented the 2017 IEEE published paper [Deep Photo Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07511.pdf) in torch as an assignment for BITS F312 Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. It transfers the style of a 'reference' image to 'content' image.

We referred [PyTorch-deep-photo-styletransfer](https://github.com/yagudin/PyTorch-deep-photo-styletransfer) for implementation.

Since the code is computationally heavy, the resolution of the images was decreased to 128x128.
